
--------------------
CTE - Cross Track Error:
Measurement of how far away from the desired trajectory the vehicle is.

--------------------
P Proportional Control:
Steers harder the further away we are from the desired trajectory.

Kp is a scaling factor called the Proportional gain
Ep is the CTE.

Kp * CTE

--------------------
D Derivative Control:
To reduce overshooting, we check the CTE rate, which is how fast we move in perpendicular
direction with respect with the desired trajectory. 

Kd is the Derivative gain
Ed is the error of the Derivative Control, which is the rate of the change of CTE.
Kd * Ed

--------------------
I Interval Control:
To solve steady state errors, we sum all the intervals CTE to know if we spend more time
on one side of the desired trajectory or the other.

Ki is the Integral Gain.
Ei is the error of the Integral Control, which is the sum of all the CTE intervals.

// P = -this->Kp * this->p_error
// D = - this->Kd * this->d_error
// I = - this->Ki * this->i_error
return -this->Kp * this->p_error - this->Kd * this->d_error - this->Ki * this->i_error;
